# **OmniCode File Extensions - Initial Standardization**  

📅 **Date:** March 15, 2025  
📜 **Version:** 1.0 (Initial Standard)  
🏢 **Project:** OmniCode Standardization  
📂 **Category:** File Execution & Structured Intelligence  
🔍 **Purpose:** Defines OmniCode’s machine-level and assembler file extensions, ensuring structured execution and biblical alignment.  

🚀 **This is the first version—additional extensions will be added as OmniCode evolves.**

## **1. Introduction**  

📖 **Genesis 2:19** → *“Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.”*  

🔥 **File extensions in OmniCode are not random—they carry biblical meaning, ensuring every file type reflects structured execution.**  

🚀 **This document establishes OmniCode’s initial file extensions, specifically for the assembler, machine code, and essential execution formats.**  

📌 **Each extension is uniquely designed to reflect OmniCode’s structured intelligence.**

## **2. Standardized OmniCode File Extensions (Initial Set)**  

🚀 **These are the first OmniCode-specific file extensions, covering assembler, machine execution, and immediate relevant files.**  

### **📌 Core Execution File Types**

| **File Type** | **Extension** | **Biblical Meaning** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **OmniCode Executable** | `.gen` | *Genesis 1:1* → "In the beginning" | Primary execution file |
| **Compiled Machine Code** | `.manna` | *Exodus 16:15* → "Bread from heaven" | Machine-optimized executable code |
| **Assembler Source Code** | `.logos` | *John 1:1* → "In the beginning was the Word" | Assembler-level OmniCode scripts |
| **Assembler Output** | `.scroll` | *Ezekiel 2:9-10* → "A scroll written on both sides" | Intermediate compiled assembler data |
| **Runtime Execution Log** | `.witness` | *Acts 1:8* → "You will be my witnesses" | Logs structured execution results |

---

### **📌 Additional Immediate Extensions**

| **File Type** | **Extension** | **Biblical Meaning** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Temporary Execution File** | `.altar` | *Genesis 22:9* → "Abraham built an altar" | Temporary execution data |
| **Error Reporting File** | `.testify` | *John 15:26* → "The Spirit of truth who testifies about me" | Stores structured error reports |
| **Configuration File** | `.ark` | *Genesis 6:14* → "The Ark, a vessel of preservation" | Stores structured intelligence system configurations |

## **3. File Execution Rules**  

🚀 **Each file type follows strict execution rules to ensure structured intelligence remains aligned.**  

✅ **`.gen` (Executable) must be compiled from `.manna` or interpreted from `.logos`.**  
✅ **`.manna` (Compiled Code) must go through structured validation before execution.**  
✅ **`.logos` (Assembler) must always be structured and traceable before processing.**  
✅ **`.scroll` (Assembler Output) must never be manually modified—only generated by the assembler.**  
✅ **`.witness` (Execution Log) must be created for every execution cycle to ensure accountability.**  

🔥 **These rules ensure that OmniCode execution remains structured, transparent, and aligned with compliance.**  

---

## **4. Next Steps**  

📌 **Adopt these initial file extensions into OmniCode development.**  
📌 **Ensure execution rules are strictly followed for each file type.**  
📌 **Expand file extensions over time, ensuring each new type follows structured intelligence principles.**  

🚀 **Now, OmniCode’s execution files are structured, meaningful, and fully aligned with purpose.**  

🔥 **This is only the first step—more file types will be added as OmniCode expands.**
