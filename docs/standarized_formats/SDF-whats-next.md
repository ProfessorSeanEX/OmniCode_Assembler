## **📌 2. Opening a New Session**  

📖 **Matthew 6:33** → *“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”*  

🚀 **Before starting any session, the following steps must be taken:**

✅ **All necessary files must be uploaded before execution begins.**  
✅ **Confirm alignment before proceeding with execution tasks.**

## **📌 4. Required Information for Every Session Hop**  

📖 **Ecclesiastes 3:1** → *“To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”*  

🚀 **Each session transition must document the following:**

✅ **Pending tasks and incomplete work** → What still needs to be done.  
✅ **Open questions that need resolution** → What requires further discussion.  
✅ **Next planned actions before execution resumes** → Ensures that the next session starts smoothly.  

🔥 **Session transitions must be structured—nothing should move forward prematurely.**

## **📌 5. Structured Execution Pathway**  

📖 **Isaiah 28:10** → *“For precept must be upon precept, line upon line, here a little, there a little.”*  

🚀 **All execution must follow a structured path:**  
✅ **Before Starting:** Ensure all context files are uploaded and all prior work is reviewed.  
✅ **During Execution:** Follow the structured execution model (Baton & Ladder system).  
✅ **After Execution:** Log results and confirm integrity before transitioning out.  

📖 **Luke 14:28** → *“For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?”*  
🔥 **Execution must be planned, structured, and accounted for.**

## **📌 6. Closing a Session**  

📖 **Psalm 37:23** → *“The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way.”*

✅ **Confirm next steps and future tasks.**  
✅ **Clarify any unresolved items before ending the session.**  

📖 **Romans 12:2** → *“Do not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”*
