# **OmniCode Execution Log - Standardized Document Format (SDF)**

📅 **Date:** March 15, 2025  
📜 **Version:** 1.0 (Initial Standard)  
🏢 **Project:** OmniCode Execution Logging Standardization  
📂 **Category:** Execution Tracking & Debugging  
🔍 **Purpose:** Establishes a structured, reproducible format for all OmniCode execution logs, ensuring traceability, accountability, and structured intelligence refinement.  

---

## **1. Log Header (Metadata Block)**

Every execution log must begin with structured metadata for indexing, categorization, and retrieval.

```yaml
---
log_id: "EX-20250315-001"
timestamp: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
execution_mode: "Interpreted / Compiled"
process: "Assembler / Terminal / OmniCode Script Execution"
status: "Success / Failure / Warning"
duration: "Time in ms"
error_code: "None / Error-XXXX"
related_logs: ["EX-20250314-002"]
description: "Brief summary of execution outcome."
---
```

💡 **Metadata ensures execution logs remain structured, searchable, and indexable.**  

---

## **2. Section 1: Execution Summary**

🔹 **Summarizes what the execution process was.**  
🔹 **Defines what was tested or processed.**  
🔹 **Outlines initial expectations vs. actual results.**  

### 📌 **Example Execution Summary:**

```md
## 1. Execution Summary  
### Log ID: EX-20250315-001
The OmniCode assembler processed an interpreted script using the Ladder & Baton execution model.

### Expected Outcome  
- Script executes successfully.
- Baton moves properly through structured execution layers.

### Actual Outcome  
- ✅ Script executed without syntax errors.
- ❌ Baton dropped unexpectedly during nested execution.
- ⚠️ Performance lag detected at `bytecode_translation.py:42`.
```

---

## **3. Section 2: Execution Breakdown**

🔹 **Logs each major execution step, ordered sequentially.**  
🔹 **Uses structured tables or lists for clarity.**  
🔹 **Includes timestamps for performance tracking.**  

### 📌 **Example Execution Breakdown:**

```md
## 2. Execution Breakdown  
| **Step** | **Timestamp** | **Action Taken** | **Result** |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | 12:03:21.120 | Script sent to Assembler | ✅ Success |
| 2 | 12:03:21.135 | Tokenizer processed OmniCode syntax | ✅ Success |
| 3 | 12:03:21.189 | Baton passed to Execution Engine | ❌ Failure |
| 4 | 12:03:21.250 | Execution halted, rollback initiated | ✅ Success |

### Notable Observations  
- The **Baton drop** occurred when processing nested loops.
- Memory usage peaked at **85% CPU** during execution.
- **Execution speed slowed by ~15ms** compared to previous runs.
```

---

## **4. Section 3: Error & Debugging Information**

🔹 **Logs all errors or unexpected behaviors encountered.**  
🔹 **Provides recommended debugging actions.**  

### 📌 **Example Error Log Entry:**

```md
## 3. Error & Debugging Information  
### Error Detected: Baton Drop  
- **File:** `execution_engine.py`
- **Line:** 108
- **Error Code:** ERR-BATON-001  
- **Description:** Execution baton was not properly handed off to the next step.

### Debugging Suggestions  
✅ Check `baton_controller.py` for proper baton validation.  
✅ Ensure **nested loops** do not interfere with baton movement.  
✅ Review execution timing—latency may have affected baton handoff.  
```

---

## **5. Section 4: Performance Analysis**

🔹 **Tracks performance metrics for execution efficiency.**  
🔹 **Compares execution time against previous logs.**  

### 📌 **Example Performance Metrics:**

```md
## 4. Performance Analysis  
| **Metric** | **Current Execution** | **Previous Execution** | **Change** |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Execution Time | 85ms | 70ms | ⬆ +15ms |
| Memory Usage | 40MB | 38MB | ⬆ +2MB |
| CPU Load | 85% | 80% | ⬆ +5% |

### Observations  
- Execution time **increased by 15ms**—potential optimization needed.  
- **CPU load increased by 5%**, indicating a processing bottleneck.  
- Future tests should focus on reducing memory consumption.  
```

---

## **6. Section 5: Summary & Next Steps**

🔹 **Summarizes the key takeaways from the log.**  
🔹 **Lists the next debugging or refinement tasks.**  

### 📌 **Example Summary & Next Steps:**

```md
## 5. Summary & Next Steps  
### Key Takeaways  
- The execution completed but encountered **baton movement issues**.  
- Performance **declined slightly**—needs optimization.  
- **Memory usage remained stable** but could be improved.  

### Next Steps  
📌 Investigate the **baton drop issue** and validate execution flow.  
📌 Optimize **bytecode translation to improve execution speed**.  
📌 Run additional tests on **nested loop execution stability**.  
```
