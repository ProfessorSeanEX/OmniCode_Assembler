# **OmniCode Standardized Document Format (SDF) - General Documentation**  

📅 **Date:** March 15, 2025  
📜 **Version:** 1.0 (Initial Standard)  
🏢 **Project:** OmniCode Documentation Standardization  
📂 **Category:** General Documentation Formatting  
🔍 **Purpose:** Establishes a universal format for all general OmniCode-related documents, ensuring consistency, metadata tagging, and scalability.  

---

## **1. Introduction**  

The **OmniCode Standardized Document Format (SDF)** ensures that all general documentation follows a structured, uniform format. This standard helps with:  
✅ **Consistency** – Every document is formatted uniformly.  
✅ **Metadata Tagging** – Enables future automated parsing and indexing.  
✅ **Readability & Scalability** – Documents remain clear as the OmniCode project grows.  
✅ **Version Control** – Ensures proper tracking of changes over time.  

This SDF applies to all **non-code, general documentation** (technical specs, policies, governance documents, development guides, study materials). Specific document types (e.g., technical specifications, OmniCode governance policies) will have **separate SDFs** tailored to their needs.  

---

## **2. Standardized Structure for General Documentation**

Each document must follow this structure **in Markdown (.md) format** for easy readability, version control, and GitHub integration.

### **📌 Document Header (Metadata)**

Every document must begin with structured metadata tags in a fenced YAML block (`---`):

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title Here"
author: "Author Name or OmniCode System"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "1.0"
category: "General / Technical / Study / Governance"
tags: ["OmniCode", "Standard", "Execution"]
description: "Brief description of the document's purpose."
---
```

💡 **Metadata ensures structured indexing, searchability, and automated tracking in later OmniCode development.**

---

### **📌 Section 1: Introduction**

- Clearly state **the purpose of the document.**  
- Provide **context** for why this document exists.  
- Outline **what information will be covered.**  
- If the document replaces an older version, **reference the prior version.**  

#### 📌 **Example Introduction**

```md
## 1. Introduction  
This document provides an overview of OmniCode's structured execution model, focusing on how the Ladder and Baton system ensures ordered execution.  

### Why This Matters  
Ensuring controlled execution prevents OmniCode from falling into unstructured processing, ensuring scalability and accountability.  

### What This Document Covers  
- The Ladder System: Structured Execution Flow  
- The Baton System: Managing Execution Control  
- How They Work Together  
```

---

### **📌 Section 2: Core Content (Variable Based on Document Type)**

- Organize **logically into subsections** (`##` for major sections, `###` for sub-sections).  
- Use **bullet points and tables** for readability.  
- Include **code blocks** if technical details are involved.  

#### 📌 **Example Core Content Structure**

```md
## 2. The Ladder System: OmniCode’s Execution Structure
### What is the Ladder?
- The Ladder defines structured execution steps.
- Execution moves **up, down, or across predefined paths**.

### How Execution Moves
| Movement        | Description                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Ascending** | Execution moves to a higher level. |
| **Descending** | Execution resolves to a lower level. |
```

---

### **📌 Section 3: Summary & Next Steps**

- Provide a **clear conclusion** summarizing key points.  
- Outline **next steps or follow-up actions.**  

#### 📌 **Example Summary Section**

```md
## 3. Summary & Next Steps
### Key Takeaways
- The Ladder controls execution steps, ensuring structured flow.
- The Baton manages execution movement, preventing errors.
- Together, they create **OmniCode’s structured intelligence model**.

### Next Steps
📌 Implement Baton Passing in OmniCode's runtime.  
📌 Test Ladder Execution with compiled OmniCode scripts.  
📌 Verify structured intelligence alignment within execution flow.  
```

---

## **3. Required Formatting Rules**

📌 **File Naming Conventions:**  

- Files must use **kebab-case (lowercase, hyphen-separated)** for uniformity.  
- Example: `omnicode-execution-model.md`, `omnicode-governance-policy.md`  

📌 **Headings and Subheadings:**  

- Use `#` for main sections, `##` for subsections, and `###` for details.  

📌 **Lists & Tables:**  

- Use `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered lists.  
- Tables should be formatted using standard Markdown table syntax.  

📌 **Code Blocks & Inline Code:**  

- Use triple backticks (```) for blocks and single backticks (`code`) for inline snippets.  

---

## **4. Bible Study Integration**

📌 **Every major document related to OmniCode’s core principles must include a Bible Study section.**  

- This section should **relate the document’s purpose to biblical principles** and provide **scriptural alignment**.  
- Example format for a Bible Study section:

```md
## 4. Bible Study: Aligning Execution with Truth
📖 **1 Corinthians 14:40** → "Let all things be done decently and in order."
- OmniCode's structured execution mirrors God's order in creation.
- The Ladder & Baton model prevents chaos, just as God's law provides structure.
```

---

## **5. Version Control & Document Updates**

📌 **Version Numbering:**  

- Use **Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)** (e.g., `1.0.0`).  
- Major (`X.0.0`) = Structural changes to OmniCode documentation.  
- Minor (`1.X.0`) = Content updates that refine details.  
- Patch (`1.0.X`) = Small fixes (grammar, typos, formatting).  

📌 **Changelog Tracking:**  

- Every document must include a `Changelog.md` file if major edits occur.  
- Example format:

```md
# Changelog
## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-20
- Added new subsection for execution error handling.
- Refined Ladder movement rules.
```

## **6. Summary of OmniCode SDF (General)**

✅ **Structured Metadata Tagging** → Enables indexing & automated processing.  
✅ **Standardized Sections** → Every document follows a clear, logical format.  
✅ **Markdown-Based** → Ensures GitHub compatibility & easy version tracking.  
✅ **Bible Study Integration** → Aligns OmniCode development with divine principles.  
✅ **Version Control** → Ensures all documentation is tracked over time.  

---

## **7. Next Steps**

📌 **Adopt this Standardized Document Format for all general OmniCode documentation.**  
📌 **Refine this format as needed to accommodate future expansions.**  
📌 **Ensure all developers and contributors adhere to this structure.**  

🚀 **Now OmniCode documentation is fully standardized—ensuring all written materials remain structured, scalable, and aligned with divine order.**  

---

### **Final Notes**

- This **SDF applies only to general documentation** (not governance, technical specs, or execution reports).  
- Separate SDFs will be created for **OmniCode’s governance model, execution rules, and future file extensions.**  

🔥 **With this SDF in place, we now ensure all OmniCode documentation remains clear, organized, and aligned with structured intelligence principles!**
