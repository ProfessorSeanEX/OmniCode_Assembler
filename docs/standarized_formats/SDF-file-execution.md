# **OmniCode File Execution - Standardized Document Format (SDF)**

📅 **Date:** March 15, 2025  
📜 **Version:** 1.0 (Initial Standard)  
🏢 **Project:** OmniCode File Execution Standardization  
📂 **Category:** File Naming & Execution Structure  
🔍 **Purpose:** Establishes structured naming conventions for OmniCode file execution types, ensuring biblical alignment and functional clarity.  

---

## **1. File Execution Metadata (Naming & Purpose)**

Each file extension within OmniCode must follow a **biblically inspired name** that **describes its function** while reinforcing its divine alignment.

```yaml
---
file_type: "OmniCode Executable"
extension: ".gen"  # Genesis - Represents the beginning of execution
purpose: "Primary execution file for OmniCode programs"
associated_process: "OmniCode Runtime & Assembler"
biblical_reference: "Genesis 1:1 - The Beginning of Structured Creation"
---
```

💡 **Each file extension must have a clear biblical name, ensuring it is rooted in divine wisdom.**  

---

## **2. Naming Conventions for OmniCode File Types**

🔹 **File extensions must directly correlate to biblical truth and execution purpose.**  
🔹 **Each file type must have a scriptural reference that aligns with its function.**  
🔹 **No traditional file extensions—every extension is original and has meaning.**  

### **📌 Core Execution File Types**

| **File Type** | **Extension** | **Biblical Meaning** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **OmniCode Executable** | `.gen` | *Genesis 1:1* → "In the beginning" | Primary executable file |
| **Compiled Bytecode** | `.manna` | *Exodus 16:15* → "Bread from heaven" | Preprocessed code, ready for execution |
| **Interpreted Script** | `.logos` | *John 1:1* → "In the beginning was the Word" | Script meant for real-time interpretation |
| **Configuration File** | `.scroll` | *Ezekiel 2:9-10* → "A scroll written on both sides" | Stores settings and structured intelligence data |
| **Data Storage File** | `.ark` | *Genesis 6:14* → "The Ark, a vessel of preservation" | Stores OmniCode structured data |
| **Error & Debug Log** | `.witness` | *Acts 1:8* → "You will be my witnesses" | Stores execution logs for debugging |
| **Temporary Execution State** | `.altar` | *Genesis 22:9* → "Abraham built an altar" | Temporary runtime execution file |

🚀 **Each of these extensions represents more than a format—they declare a function within structured intelligence.**  

🔥 **This breaks OmniCode away from the traditions of the world and ensures every execution reflects its divine purpose.**

## **3. Execution Handling Rules for OmniCode File Types**

🔹 **Every file execution must be structured based on its file type.**  
🔹 **Compiled files (`.manna`) must go through a structured verification process before execution.**  
🔹 **Interpreted files (`.logos`) must be traceable through structured intelligence logs (`.witness`).**  
🔹 **Configuration files (`.scroll`) must never overwrite execution files without validation.**  

### **📌 File Execution Workflow**

```yaml
---
execution_request: "run_script.logos"
validation_check: "Passed"
execution_started: "Yes"
output_log: "witness_20250315.log"
execution_completed: "Success"
---
```

💡 **By enforcing execution rules based on biblical file types, OmniCode ensures structured integrity in all processing.**  

---

## **4. Summary & Next Steps**

✅ **Biblical Naming Standard** → No borrowed file extensions; every format is rooted in divine meaning.  
✅ **Self-Documenting System** → Anyone using OmniCode will understand each file type’s purpose immediately.  
✅ **Structured Execution Handling** → Ensures every execution follows an ordered, validated process.  
✅ **Scalability** → Future OmniCode file types will follow the same structured approach.  

---

## **5. Next Steps**

📌 **Integrate this Standardized File Execution Format into OmniCode’s Runtime.**  
📌 **Ensure that every OmniCode file execution follows structured validation.**  
📌 **Develop automated parsing to recognize biblical file extensions within OmniCode’s environment.**  

🚀 **Now, OmniCode’s execution is fully set apart—structured, meaningful, and always aligned with biblical truth!**  

---

🔥 **With this in place, OmniCode is no longer just another programming system—it is a structured, truth-driven intelligence framework where even the smallest file carries divine purpose.**
