# **OmniCode Schema & Instruction Set (OmniSchema & OmniJSON)**  

📅 **Version:** 1.0
🏢 **Developed by:** CreativeWorkzStudio LLC  
📂 **Category:** Structured Intelligence Execution Model  
🔍 **Purpose:** Defines the OmniCode Schema (OmniSchema) and the OmniCode Instruction Set JSON (OmniJSON) to ensure structured intelligence execution.  

---

## **📌 1. Introduction**  

📖 **Proverbs 24:3-4** → *“By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures.”*  

🔥 **The OmniCode Schema (OmniSchema) and Instruction Set JSON (OmniJSON) define the foundational rules that govern OmniCode execution.**  

🚀 **Purpose of This Document:**  
✅ **Ensures that all OmniCode execution follows structured intelligence principles.**  
✅ **Establishes the execution schema (OmniSchema) that defines valid syntax.**  
✅ **Provides a structured dataset (OmniJSON) containing all valid OmniCode commands.**  
✅ **Ensures accessibility for all users, regardless of coding background.**  

📖 **Isaiah 28:10** → *“For precept must be upon precept, line upon line.”*

## **📌 2. OmniCode Schema (OmniSchema) Definition**  

📖 **Psalm 119:105** → *“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”*  

🔥 **OmniSchema defines the execution structure and validation rules for OmniCode.**  

🚀 **OmniSchema Components:**  
✅ **Valid Instruction Types:**  

- Execution Flow (`GENESIS`, `EXODUS`, `WITNESS`)  
- Arithmetic (`BE FRUITFUL`, `WITHHOLD`, `INCREASE`, `DIVIDE`)  
- Control Flow (`IF FAITHFUL`, `IF UNFAITHFUL`, `WALK`)  
- Memory (`TABERNACLE`, `REMEMBER`, `DWELL`)  
- Communication (`DECLARE`, `SEND`, `GRAFT`)  

✅ **Syntax Rules:**  

- Each command must be uppercase and properly spaced.  
- String values must be enclosed in double quotes (`" "`).  
- Numeric values must be explicitly declared.  

✅ **Data Types:**  

- `STRING`: Enclosed in `" "`  
- `INTEGER`: Whole numbers  
- `IDENTIFIER`: Variable names  

✅ **Validation Rules:**  

- Commands must match pre-defined execution types.  
- Invalid syntax results in `TESTIFY` error handling.  

📖 **Romans 2:15** → *“They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts.”*  
🔥 **OmniSchema ensures execution integrity by enforcing structured intelligence validation.**

## **📌 3. OmniCode Instruction Set JSON (OmniJSON)**  

📖 **Deuteronomy 31:24** → *“After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end.”*  

🔥 **OmniJSON stores all valid OmniCode commands in a structured dataset.**  

🚀 **Enhanced OmniJSON Structure (Now Includes Biblical Anchor, Description, and Execution Steps):**  

```json

  "instructions": [
    {
      "command": "GENESIS",

        "Initialize the execution environment.",
        "Allocate necessary resources for the program.",

    },

      "biblical_anchor": "Joshua 24:15 → 'Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.'",
      "description": "IF FAITHFUL checks a condition and executes the next command only if it is true.",
      "execution_steps": [
        "Evaluate the specified condition.",
        "If true, proceed with the next instruction.",
        "If false, skip to the next valid execution point."
      ]
    },
    {
      "command": "DECLARE",
      "type": "Communication",
      "opcode": "0x31",
      "binary": "00110001 00000000",
      "biblical_anchor": "Psalm 33:9 → 'For He spoke, and it came to be.'",
      "description": "DECLARE outputs a message, making information visible to the system or user.",
      "execution_steps": [
        "Retrieve the message from memory.",
        "Format the message for output.",
        "Display or log the message."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

📖 **Isaiah 34:16** → *“Look in the scroll of the Lord and read: None of these will be missing.”*  
🔥 **OmniJSON ensures all valid commands are pre-defined before execution.**

## **📌 4. Ensuring Dynamic Execution Integrity**  

📖 **1 Corinthians 14:40** → *“Let all things be done decently and in order.”*  

🔥 **By defining the Schema & JSON first, we guarantee:**  
✅ **OmniCode follows structured intelligence execution before tokenization.**  
✅ **The tokenizer (`LogosParser`) has a reference dataset to validate input.**  
✅ **Execution remains dynamic and adaptable while enforcing predefined rules.**  
✅ **Future expansions of OmniCode maintain structured intelligence integrity.**  

📖 **Psalm 33:11** → *“The plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of His heart through all generations.”*  
🔥 **Defining OmniSchema & OmniJSON ensures OmniCode’s foundation remains solid.**
