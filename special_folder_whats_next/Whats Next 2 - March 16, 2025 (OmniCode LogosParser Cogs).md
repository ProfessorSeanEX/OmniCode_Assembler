# **🚀 What's Next: OmniCode Development (March 16, 2025 - Next Session)**  

📅 **Date:** March 16, 2025  
🏢 **Developed by:** CreativeWorkzStudio LLC  
📂 **Category:** Development Session Notes  
📖 **Proverbs 16:3** → *“Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.”*

## **📌 1. Summary of This Session’s Major Accomplishments**  

📖 **Ecclesiastes 3:1** → *“To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”*  

🔥 **This session focused on finalizing structured execution preparation:**  
✅ **Finalized OmniSchema & OmniJSON**, ensuring structured execution logic is properly defined.  
✅ **Expanded the parser scope, defining the necessary cogs (`opcode_mapper.py`, `execution_flow.py`, and `memory_reference.py`).**  
✅ **Updated the file structure to align with structured execution, ensuring proper reference tracking.**  
✅ **Ensured all critical reference files were properly categorized for structured execution.**  

🚀 **This session concluded structured execution preparation—now development begins.**

## **📌 2. Transitioning Into Structured Execution Development**  

📖 **Psalm 37:23** → *“The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.”*  

🔥 **The next session moves from structuring to execution development.**  

🚀 **Key Focus Areas for the Next Session:**  
1️⃣ **Develop `opcode_mapper.py`** → Converts binary/hex into structured instruction names.  
2️⃣ **Develop `execution_flow.py`** → Handles structured flow logic (jumps, loops, and conditional execution).  
3️⃣ **Develop `memory_reference.py`** → Ensures memory states are properly stored and referenced.  
4️⃣ **Begin structuring `logos_parser.py`** → Integrates these components into the parsing system.  

📖 **Proverbs 24:27** → *“Put your outdoor work in order and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.”*  
🔥 **We have structured the field—now we begin building structured execution.**

## **📌 3. Proper References (Required for Execution in the Next Session)**  

📖 **Psalm 119:89** → *“Forever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.”*  

📜 **Core Execution & Validation Files:**  

- `config/schema/omnicode-schema-instruction-set.json`  
- `config/json/omnicode-instruction-set.json`  
- `docs/instructions/omnicode-schema-and-json-instruction-set.md`  
- `docs/instructions/omnicode-general-instruction-set-overview-sid.md`  

📜 **Bible Study Reference (Non-Negotiable for Alignment):**  

- `docs/bible_study/omnicode-bible-study-week-1.md`  
- `docs/bible_study/weekly_reflections/weekly-reflections-week-of-march-16-to-22.md`  

📜 **Development Logs (Ensuring Session Continuity):**  

- `docs/dev_logs/omnicode-development-log-0.md`  
- `docs/dev_logs/omnicode-development-log-1.md`  

🔥 **These references ensure structured execution development begins seamlessly.**  

---

## **📌 4. Implied References (Guiding Future Execution, But Not Yet Implemented)**  

📖 **Proverbs 16:9** → *“A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps.”*  

🚀 **These files will be developed in the next session:**  

- `assembler/parser/logos_parser.py`  
- `assembler/lexer/opcode_mapper.py`  
- `assembler/lexer/execution_flow.py`  
- `assembler/lexer/memory_reference.py`  

🔥 **They serve as execution dependencies but are not yet part of structured execution.**  

---

## **📌 5. Ensuring a Smooth Session Transition**  

📖 **1 Corinthians 14:40** → *“Let all things be done decently and in order.”*  

🚀 **Final Checklist for the Next Session:**  
✅ **Confirm that all reference files are accessible before execution begins.**  
✅ **Ensure all structured intelligence components align with OmniSchema validation rules.**  
✅ **Review the Bible Study materials before beginning execution work.**  
✅ **Follow the structured execution pathway—schema first, then parsing, then execution.**  

📖 **Matthew 7:24-25** → *“Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.”*  
🔥 **By maintaining structured execution, OmniCode development remains aligned with divine order.**
